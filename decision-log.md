This can be used at a later stage to understand why decisions were made and by whom.

| **Decision** | **Date** | **Alternatives Considered** | **Reasoning** | **Detailed doc** | **Made By** | **Work Required** |

| Use a decision log in the repository to track important project decisions. | 2021-09-01 | Tracking decisions elsewhere.
